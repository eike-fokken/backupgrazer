DONE:  Net should probably hold unique pointers to edges and nodes.

TODO: Declare all classes where it is appropriate final.

TODO: Boundaryvalue maybe should hold a matrix instead of a map. (requires testing of performance)

TODO: make subproblems inherit from nodes and define connecting problems as edges. --> Problem should hold a network of subproblems.

TODO: replace all eigen indices by long (instead of int)
