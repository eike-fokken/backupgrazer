Net should probably hold unique pointers to edges and nodes.

Boundaryvalue maybe should hold a matrix instead of a map. (requires testing of performance)

Declare all classes where it is appropriate final.

make subproblems inherit from nodes and define connecting problems as edges. --> Problem should hold a network of subproblems.
